Terraform workspaces refer to separate instances of state data inside the same Terraform working directory¹. Here are some of the key commands related to Terraform workspaces:

- `terraform workspace new <name>`: Creates a new workspace³.
- `terraform workspace select <name>`: Selects an existing workspace³.
- `terraform workspace list`: Lists all available workspaces³.
- `terraform workspace show`: Shows the currently selected workspace³.
- `terraform workspace delete <name>`: Deletes an existing workspace³.

Remember, for a given working directory, you can only select one workspace at a time¹.
Most Terraform commands only interact with the currently selected workspace¹. 
This includes provisioning and state manipulation¹..

Sure, here are examples of Terraform workspace commands for workspaces named `dev`, `qa`, and `uat`:

- **Creating a new workspace**:
    - For `dev`: `terraform workspace new dev`
    - For `qa`: `terraform workspace new qa`
    - For `uat`: `terraform workspace new uat`

- **Selecting an existing workspace**:
    - For `dev`: `terraform workspace select dev`
    - For `qa`: `terraform workspace select qa`
    - For `uat`: `terraform workspace select uat`

- **Listing all available workspaces**: `terraform workspace list`
    - This will list all workspaces including `dev`, `qa`, and `uat`.

- **Showing the currently selected workspace**: `terraform workspace show`
    - This will show the currently selected workspace, which could be `dev`, `qa`, or `uat` depending on the last `select` command.

- **Deleting an existing workspace**:
    - For `dev`: `terraform workspace delete dev`
    - For `qa`: `terraform workspace delete qa`
    - For `uat`: `terraform workspace delete uat`

Please replace `dev`, `qa`, and `uat` with your actual workspace names. Also, ensure you're in the correct directory where your Terraform configuration files are located before running these commands. Remember, most Terraform commands only interact with the currently selected workspace. This includes provisioning and state manipulation. So, be careful while selecting and deleting workspaces.
